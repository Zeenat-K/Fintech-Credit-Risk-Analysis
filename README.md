In this project, data has been analyzed to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their loan instalments.

I have used Python for EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency to default.

Key highlights of the project include:

* Aggregated and prepped 2 huge datasets including data imputation, handling negative value and **outlier analysis** for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Addressed imbalanced data issue through strategic analysis.
* Employed **univariate** and **bivariate** analysis techniques to understand the impact of consumer and loan attributes on default tendencies.
* Merged datasets and **categorized clients into Non-Defaulters and Defaulters** based on 'TARGET' variable for in-depth analysis.

We've found some interesting insights, further mentioned in the notebook!

Data has been sourced from Kaggle.  
Included three datasets: Application_data, Previous_application_data and Column_data.
